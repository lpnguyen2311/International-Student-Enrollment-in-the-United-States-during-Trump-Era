### Problem Statement
Over one million international students at all academic levels are currently pursuing their education in the United States. Even though the total volume of international students has continued to rise, the annual growth rate has slowed down. Moreover, the number of newly enrolled students is dropping. Some research suggests that President Trump’s election and his anti-immigrant policies are potentially responsible for this decline. This paper presents quantitative empirical research I conducted to elucidate the effect of President Trump’s election and his administration on international students.

### Approach
I use a fix effect regression model. I introduce a dummy variable to control for the effect of President Trump on international students enrollment before and after the election. The dummy variable takes the value of 0 before the election and 1 otherwise. I then include previously considered impactful determinants, consisting of both push and pull factors, to examine the established relationship

### Conclusions
The results only show a statistically significant decrease in the enrollment of non-degree students. In addition, the change in this group does not make a vital impact on the U.S. economy. Even though the data suggested a decline in the enrollment, I failed to establish a causal relationship between Trump’s election and international student enrollment. 

### Next Steps
I believe a continued thorough study and updated data will give a more complete picture of the impact of Trump’s election in specific and the changes in political climate in general to the international students’ determinants to mobilize.
